This is for holding a site for our CS 7641 Machine Learning project: 

The choice of movie components – director, genre, cast, run-time – determine the success of a movie. An improper combination of these factors could lead to box office flops. Despite its highly anticipated release, why did Blade Runner 2049 fall short of public expectations2?

We believe that a combination of features could be optimized to yield the highest movie rating and box office revenue. These choices could help drive the movie making process.
